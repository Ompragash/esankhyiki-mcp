## COMPONENT BREAKDOWN

**Food (45% of CPI)**: Most volatile
- Current: 2.47%
- Winter peak expected (Jan): 2-3%
- Monsoon trough expected (Aug): -1 to 0%
- Key driver: Vegetable prices (monsoon dependent)

**Fuel (6% of CPI)**: Deflationary
- Current: -1.49%
- Monitoring: Oil prices (alert if >$90/bbl)
- Base case: stays mildly deflationary

**Housing (11% of CPI)**: Most stable
- Current: 3.2%
- Expected: Stay at 2.8-3.2% (structural)
- Least volatile, most predictable component

**Core/Misc (38% of CPI)**: Moderate
- Current: ~3.5%
- Expected: Stay at 3.4-3.7%
- Includes health, education, transport (wage-driven)

## EASY INTERPRETATION: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

**For RBI**:
- Current policy stance appropriate
- No immediate rate change needed
- Monitor monsoon before April MPC meeting

**For Government**:
- Inflation well-controlled
- Prepare buffer stock releases if monsoon poor
- No emergency price controls needed

**For Investors**:
- Inflation risk limited downside (0.19% average)
- Inflation risk limited upside (1.71% Jan)
- Could impact bond yields if monsoon poor

**For Consumers**:
- Food prices likely to fall Jun-Oct (good news)
- Prices likely to rise Nov-Feb (seasonal)
- Overall inflation low (purchasing power stable)

## QUICK ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Is inflation a problem?**
A: No. At 4.26%, well within RBI's 2-6% target. 5-year trend declining toward 4% goal.

**Q: Will inflation get worse?**
A: Probably not (base case 0.19% avg). Could briefly spike if monsoon poor (+1.7% possible) or cool further if monsoon strong (-0.25% possible).

**Q: What's driving inflation?**
A: 60% food prices (seasonal, monsoon-dependent), 20% housing (steady), 20% other services.

**Q: Why focus on monsoon?**
A: Monsoon rains determine vegetable harvests. Controls food inflation ±2 pp impact.

**Q: What should I do?**
A: Monitor April monsoon forecast. If poor, expect higher inflation Jun-Oct. If strong, expect lower inflation. Oil prices and rupee matter but less critical.

**Q: Will RBI cut rates?**
A: Unlikely immediately. But if deflation occurs (strong monsoon case), rate cuts possible by end-2025.

**Q: Is this forecast reliable?**
A: 80% confident for next 6 months (Feb-Jul). 60% confident for Jul-Jan. Monsoon is single biggest wildcard.
