## PART F: ASSUMPTION SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### F.1 One-at-a-Time Sensitivity

**Impact of ±1 Standard Deviation Change:**

| Factor | Base Case | -1 SD (Optimistic) | +1 SD (Pessimistic) | Inflation Change |
|--------|-----------|----|----|-----|
| Monsoon (cm) | 88.7 | 100.7 | 76.7 | ±0.8% |
| Oil Price ($/bbl) | 80 | 60 | 100 | ±0.3% |
| Wage Growth (%) | 4.5% | 3.5% | 5.5% | ±0.1% |
| Rupee (per USD) | 83.5 | 80.5 | 86.5 | ±0.1% |
| Food Yield | 100% | 110% | 90% | ±0.5% |

**Most Sensitive Factors:**

2. Food yields: ±0.5% impact
3. Oil prices: ±0.3% impact
4. Wage growth: ±0.1% impact
5. Rupee: ±0.1% impact

### F.2 Joint Scenarios

**Double Shock: Poor Monsoon + High Oil**
- Base forecast: 0.19% inflation
- Combined impact: 0.9% (monsoon) + 0.3% (oil) = 1.2%
- Forecast: 1.39% inflation (vs 1.68% pessimistic baseline)

**Double Upside: Good Monsoon + Low Oil**
- Base forecast: 0.19% inflation
- Combined impact: -0.8% (monsoon) - 0.3% (oil) = -1.1%
- Forecast: -0.91% inflation (vs -0.25% optimistic baseline)

## PART G: RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### G.1 for RBI/Policymakers

**If Poor Monsoon Occurs (Sep-Oct):**
- Monitor food inflation closely (watch 6-month trend)
- If headline inflation approaches 5%, consider hold on rates
- If breaches 5%, consider modest rate hike (25 bps)
- Communicate forward guidance to anchor expectations

**If Oil Spikes Above $100:**
- Assess structural vs transitory nature
- May need to tolerate temporary inflation spike
- Monitor pass-through to broader inflation
- Consider oil price shock absorber (subsidy)

**If Wage Inflation Accelerates:**
- Earlier rate hike signal needed (more hawkish)
- Focus on core inflation as policy-relevant measure
- Tighten liquidity stance

**If Rupee Weakens Sharply:**
- May need defensive rate hike
- Monitor FII flows, RBI verbal intervention
- But don't overreact to temporary weakness

### G.2 for Business Planning

**If Optimistic Scenario Emerges:**
- Opportunity for margin expansion
- Plan inventory buildup (lower inflation erodes value)
- Consider price reductions strategically
- Invest in growth

**If Pessimistic Scenario Emerges:**
- Margin pressure likely
- Manage cost inflation carefully
- Review supplier contracts
- May need price increases (consumer acceptance risk)

### G.3 for Consumers/Savers

**High Inflation Risk (Pessimistic):**
- Consider inflation-linked bonds (ILGS)
- Real asset allocation (gold, real estate)
- Fixed deposits: negotiate higher rates
- Debt: consider fixed-rate borrowing now

**Low Inflation (Optimistic):**
- Higher real returns on fixed income
- Bonds attractive
- Equity valuations at fair level
- Consider equities over gold
